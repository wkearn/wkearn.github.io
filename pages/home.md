<p>I study how fundamental physical processes like the flow of water and the transport of sediments and nutrients lead to large-scale patterns in wetlands. I particularly like to use tools from statistics, signal processing, and dynamical systems theory to interpret data from environmental sensors in terms of the structure and functioning of wetlands.</p>
<p>I am a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href="http://evsc.virginia.edu">Department of Environmental Sciences</a> at the University of Virginia, where I am working with <a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/reidenbach/">Matthew Reidenbach</a> to understand how the structure of turbulence in salt marsh creeks controls sediment fluxes between marshes and the shallow coastal bays on the <a href="https://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu/home2/">Eastern Shore of Virginia</a>. I graduated in 2018 from Boston University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/sergio-fagherazzi/">Sergio Fagherazzi</a> on observations of water and sediment fluxes at the <a href="http://pie-lter.ecosystems.mbl.edu/">Plum Island Ecosystems LTER</a>.</p>
