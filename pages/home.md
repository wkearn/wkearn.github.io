I study how fundamental physical processes like the flow of water and the transport of sediments and nutrients lead to large-scale patterns in coastal environments. I use statistical techniques to combine models with data from environmental sensors to make predictions about the structure and function of these ecosystems.


I am an ASEE postdoctoral fellow in the Seafloor Sciences branch of the [Naval Research Laboratory](https://nrl.navy.mil), where I am building stochastic models of seafloor roughness. I was previously a postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Environmental Sciences](http://evsc.virginia.edu) at the University of Virginia, where I worked with [Matthew Reidenbach](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/reidenbach/) to understand how the structure of turbulence in salt marsh creeks controls sediment fluxes between marshes and the shallow coastal bays on the [Eastern Shore of Virginia](https://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu/home2/). I graduated in 2018 from Boston University, where I worked with [Sergio Fagherazzi](https://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/sergio-fagherazzi/) on observations of water and sediment fluxes at the [Plum Island Ecosystems LTER](http://pie-lter.ecosystems.mbl.edu/).
