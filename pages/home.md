<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/earth/">Department of Earth and Environment</a> at Boston University. I work with <a href="http://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/sergio-fagherazzi/">Sergio Fagherazzi</a> to study how fundamental physical processes like the flow of water and the transport of sediments and nutrients lead to large-scale patterns in wetlands. I particularly like to use tools from statistics, signal processing, and dynamical systems theory to interpret data from environmental sensors in terms of the structure and functioning of wetlands.</p>
